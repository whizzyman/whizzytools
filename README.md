Instructions:

1. Create a directory on your device and copy the compressed whizzytools-main.zip file into it.
2. Decompress the whizzytools-main.zip file. It will not require a password.
3. Once the file is decompressed, you will find the /whizzytools-main directory. Navigate to it.
4. Navigate to the /shareable subdirectory.
5. Decompress shareable.rar. When prompted for a password, enter: 112233445566.
6. Decompression will create a new /shareable subdirectory. Inside it, you will find the source code.
7. Access the /guide subdirectory and open the Developer's Guide.pdf to start configuring your project.

Good luck!
