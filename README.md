Instructions: 

1. Upon decompressing the downloaded whizzytools-main.zip file, you will obtain a directory with the same name. Access it and navigate to the /shareable subdirectory.
2. Decompress the shareable.rar file. When prompted for a password, enter: 112233445566.
3. Decompression will create a new /shareable subdirectory. Inside it, you will find the source code.
4. Access the /guide subdirectory and open the Developer's Guide.pdf to start configuring your project.

Good luck!
